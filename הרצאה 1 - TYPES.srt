00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,690
A type is how Python represents different types of data.

1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,070
In this video, we will discuss some widely used types in Python.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,780
You can have different types in Python.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:19,800
They can be integers like 11, real numbers like 21.213, they can even be words.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,460
Integers, real numbers, and words can be expressed as different data types.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,990
The following chart summarizes three data types for the last examples.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,520
The first column indicates the expression.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,380
The second column indicates the data type.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,750
We can see the actual data type in Python by using the type command.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,350
We can have int, which stands for an integer and float that stands for

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,750
float, essentially a real number.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,810
The type string is a sequence of characters.

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,570
Here are some integers.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,520
Integers can be negative or positive.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,830
It should be noted that there is a finite range of integers but it is quite large.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,570
Floats are real numbers.

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,020
They include the integers but also numbers in between the integers.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,686
Consider the numbers between 0 and 1.

18
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:10,530
We can select numbers in between them.

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,490
These numbers are floats.

20
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,485
Similarly, consider the numbers between 0.5 and 0.6.

21
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:20,200
We can select numbers in between them.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,890
These are floats as well.

23
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,850
We can continue the process zooming in for different numbers.

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,710
Of course there is a limit but it is quite small.

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,160
You can change the type of the expression in Python, this is called typecasting.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,980
You can convert an int to a float.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,760
For example, you can convert or cast the integer 2 to a float 2.0.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,830
Nothing really changes, if you cast a float to an integer, you must be careful.

29
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,990
For example, if you cast the float 1.1 to 1, you will lose some information.

30
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,930
If a string contains an integer value, you can convert it to int.

31
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,860
If we convert a string that contains a non-integer value, we get an error.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,360
Check out more examples in the lab.

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,790
You can convert an int to a string or a float to a string.

34
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,890
Boolean is another important type in Python.

35
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,560
A Boolean can take on two values.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,490
The first value is True, just remember we use an uppercase T.

37
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,810
Boolean values can also be False with an uppercase F.

38
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,900
Using the type command on a Boolean value, we obtain the term bool.

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,260
This is short for Boolean, if we cast a Boolean True to an integer or

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,430
float, we will get a 1.

41
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,090
If we cast a Boolean False to an integer or float, we get a 0.

42
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,740
If you cast a 1 to a Boolean, you get a True.

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,260
Similarly, if you cast a 0 to a Boolean, you get a False.

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,340
Check the labs for more examples or

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,250
check Python.org for other kinds of types in Python.
